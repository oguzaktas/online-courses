/*
Instructions
Using the populations table focused only for the year 2015, create a new field aliased as popsize_group to organize population size into
- 'large' (> 50 million),
- 'medium' (> 1 million), and
- 'small' groups.
Select only the country code, population size, and this new popsize_group as fields.
- Use INTO to save the result of the previous query as pop_plus. You can see an example of this in the countries_plus code in the assignment text. 
Make sure to include a ; at the end of your WHERE clause!
- Then, include another query below your first query to display all the records in pop_plus using SELECT * FROM pop_plus; 
so that you generate results and this will display pop_plus in query result.
- Keep the first query intact that creates pop_plus using INTO.
- Write a query to join countries_plus AS c on the left with pop_plus AS p on the right matching on the country code fields.
- Sort the data based on geosize_group, in ascending order so that large appears on top.
- Select the name, continent, geosize_group, and popsize_group fields.

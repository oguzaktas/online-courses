    "[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) is a just-in-time function compiler that exposes a simple interface that allows programmers to accelerate numerically-focused Python functions with very little code modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session you will learn first how to use Numba to compile functions for the CPU, and will receive an introduction to the inner workings of the Numba compiler. You will then proceed to learn how to accelerate numerically-focuses Python functions on massively parallel CUDA-enabled GPUs, along with some techniques for managing memory between a CPU host and GPU device. Throughout the session you will be executing and timing functions in order to observe the kinds of massive speedups made possible by GPU-accelerating Python functions with Numba."

    "## What is Numba?\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is a **just-in-time**, **type-specializing**, **function compiler** for accelerating **numerically-focused** Python.  That's a long list, so let's break down those terms:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **function compiler**: Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions.  Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function. \n",
    " * **type-specializing**: Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using.  Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow.  In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n",
    " * **just-in-time**: Numba translates functions when they are first called.  This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using.  This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application\n",
    " * **numerically-focused**: Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like `int`, `float`, and `complex`.  There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU.  To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays."

This is because by default, Numba will fall back to a mode, called \"object mode,\" which does not do type-specialization. Object mode exists to enable other Numba functionality, but in many cases, you want Numba to tell you if type inference fails. You can force \"nopython mode\" (the other compilation mode) by passing the `nopython` argument to the decorator:"

If our calculation does not involve enough math operations (often called \"arithmetic intensity\"), then the GPU will spend most of its time waiting for data to move around.\n",

Scalar code using data types that are 32 and 64-bit run basically the same speed on the CPU, but 64-bit data types have a significant performance cost on the GPU.  Basic arithmetic on 64-bit floats can be anywhere from 2x (Pascal-architecture Tesla) to 24x (Maxwell-architecture GeForce) slower than 32-bit floats.  NumPy defaults to 64-bit data types when creating arrays, so it is important to set the `dtype` attribute or use the `ndarray.astype()` method to pick 32-bit types when you need them.\n",

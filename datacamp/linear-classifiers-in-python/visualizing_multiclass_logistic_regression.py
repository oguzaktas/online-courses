'''
Instructions
- Create a new logistic regression object (also with C=100) to be used for binary classification.
- Visualize this binary classifier with plot_classifier... does it look reasonable?

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Print training accuracies
print("Softmax     training accuracy:", lr_mn.score(X_train, y_train))
print("One-vs-rest training accuracy:", lr_ovr.score(X_train, y_train))

# Create the binary classifier (class 1 vs. rest)
lr_class_1 = LogisticRegression(C=100)
lr_class_1.fit(X_train, y_train==1)

# Plot the binary classifier (class 1 vs. rest)
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train==1, lr_class_1)

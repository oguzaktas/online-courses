# Import the module and function
from skimage.transform import resize

# Set proportional height so its half its size
height = int(dogs_banner.shape[0] / 2)
width = int(dogs_banner.shape[1] / 2)

# Resize using the calculated proportional height and width
image_resized = resize(dogs_banner, (height, width),
                       anti_aliasing=True)

# Show the original and rotated image
show_image(dogs_banner, 'Original')

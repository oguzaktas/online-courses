Instructions
- Generate boolean arrays that answer the following questions:
- Which areas in my_house are greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10?
- Which areas are smaller than 11 in both my_house and your_house? Make sure to wrap both commands in print() statement, so that you can inspect the output.

# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10
print(np.logical_or(my_house > 18.5, my_house < 10))

# Both my_house and your_house smaller than 11
print(np.logical_and(my_house < 11, your_house < 11))

/* Instructions
- Create a var named playerA and with the name Alex as a string literal as its value.
- Change the point value of the ace of diamonds so it is worth 11 points, instead of the original value of 1 point it was assigned.
- Add jackClubs and aceDiamonds to calculate the value of Alex's hand and print the result.
*/

// Create a mutable variable for Alex as player A
var playerA = "Alex"

// Change the point value of A♦ from 1 to 11
aceDiamonds = 11

// Calculate hand value for J♣ and A♦
println(jackClubs + aceDiamonds)

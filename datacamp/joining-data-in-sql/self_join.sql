Instructions
- Join populations with itself ON country_code.
- Select the country_code from p1 and the size field from both p1 and p2. SQL won't allow same-named fields, 
so alias p1.size as size2010 and p2.size as size2015.
Notice from the result that for each country_code you have four entries laying out all combinations of 2010 and 2015.
- Extend the ON in your query to include only those records where the p1.year (2010) matches with p2.year - 5 (2015 - 5 = 2010). 
This will omit the three entries per country_code that you aren't interested in.

# multilayer neural networks relu

'''
In this exercise, you'll write code to do forward propagation for a neural network with 2 hidden layers. 
Each hidden layer has two nodes. The input data has been preloaded as input_data. 
The nodes in the first hidden layer are called node_0_0 and node_0_1. 
Their weights are pre-loaded as weights['node_0_0'] and weights['node_0_1'] respectively.

The nodes in the second hidden layer are called node_1_0 and node_1_1. 
Their weights are pre-loaded as weights['node_1_0'] and weights['node_1_1'] respectively.

We then create a model output from the hidden nodes using weights pre-loaded as weights['output'].

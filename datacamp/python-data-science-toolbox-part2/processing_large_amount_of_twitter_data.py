Instructions
- Initialize an empty dictionary counts_dict for storing the results of processing the Twitter data.
- Iterate over the 'tweets.csv' file by using a for loop. Use the loop variable chunk and iterate over the call to pd.read_csv() with a chunksize of 10.
- In the inner loop, iterate over the column 'lang' in chunk by using a for loop. Use the loop variable entry.

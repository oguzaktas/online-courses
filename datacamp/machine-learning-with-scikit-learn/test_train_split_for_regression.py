'''
Instructions
- Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model, mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics, and train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
- Using X and y, create training and test sets such that 30% is used for testing and 70% for training. Use a random state of 42.
- Create a linear regression regressor called reg_all, fit it to the training set, and evaluate it on the test set.
- Compute and print the R2 score using the .score() method on the test set.
- Compute and print the RMSE. To do this, first compute the Mean Squared Error using the mean_squared_error() 
function with the arguments y_test and y_pred, and then take its square root using np.sqrt().

# Create training and test sets
